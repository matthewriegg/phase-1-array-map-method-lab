// `map()` takes 2 arguments â€” a callback and the optional context. The callback is
// called for each value in the original array and the modified value is added to a
// new array. Its return value is a new array that is the same length as the
// original array. Using `map()` saves time while making the code simpler and more
// expressive.



// const array1 = [1, 4, 9, 16];

// // pass a function to map
// const map1 = array1.map(x => x * 2);

// console.log(map1);
// expected output: Array [2, 8, 18, 32]


// split and join

// own titleCase function
// used map

// then used map to call function i made up
